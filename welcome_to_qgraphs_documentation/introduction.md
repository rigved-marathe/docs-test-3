### Why QGraph?[¶](#why-qgraph) {#why-qgraph}

QGraph is the easiest way to send notifications to your app users. When you use QGraph, you do not need to worry about intricacies and mechanism of sending notifications, which vary widely across different platforms. These intricacies are all abstracted out in our SDK.

We have made the process of sending notifications as simple as writing a “Hello World!” program. From registering on our site to sending a test notification should take less than 15 minutes.

We provide the capabilities for fine grained segmentation and message customization at per user level. We provide detailed statistics about the response to the notifications.
